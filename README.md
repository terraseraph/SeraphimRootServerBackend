# SeraphimRootServerBackend

Node server behind the root server, controls the data and socket connections.

## Installation

- Clone this repo
- run `npm install` Might take a while
- to begin, run `npm start` this will begin the server on port 4300

## Notes

- This was built and tested on node version 10.15.0
- This server provides a basic API, that i have yet to properly publish. To see what paths you can get just peek into index.js
- This repo does not come wiht a UI, please find the one under SeraphimRootServerFrontEnd
- MASSIVE WIP!
